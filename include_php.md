# {include\_php} #

{include\_php} tag was added for compatibility with Smarty. It is a synonym of {include\_javascript}. Use the [{include\_javascript}](include_javascript.md) tag instead of it in your JavaScript only templates if you want to load and execute javascript code in your template at run-time.
