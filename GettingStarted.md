# Getting Started #

Using client side templates lets you avoid hassle of tedious and error-prone manual manipulations with strings and DHTML objects, and helps you create Model-View-Controller JavaScript application where the presentation and the logic are clearly separated.

Although there are a lot of browser-side Javascript template engines available, jSmart has some unique features that sets this project apart from the rest.

jSmart implements rich and well established syntax of the popular PHP template engine [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net) familiar to many developers around the world. Together with limitied build-in support for PHP language constructs and libraries like [php.js](http://phpjs.org) it creates possibility to use the same set of templates both on the server and the client side.

**jSmart documentation is still incomplete, but you can use Smarty documentation on [www.smarty.net/docs/en/](http://www.smarty.net/docs/en).
Almost all of Smarty 3 (and Smarty 2) syntax is supported.**
